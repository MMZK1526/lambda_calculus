# Lambda Calculus parser & evaluator.

TODO: Documentation

Use `import 'package:lambda_calculus/lambda_calculus.dart';` to use this library.

At first I wanted to program it with a functional language such as `Haskell`, but then I decided to practice writing functions without using recursion. I chose to program with `dart` because it can be turned easily into `javascript` and deployed to the web if necessary.

Currently, it supports untyped Lambda Calculus as well as type construction.

See [here](example/example.dart) for examples.

If you notice any issues or have any suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or contact me via email.
