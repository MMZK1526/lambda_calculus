# Lambda Calculus parser & evaluator.

Use `import 'package:lambda_calculus/lambda_calculus.dart';` to use this library.

At first I wanted to program it with a functional language such as `Haskell`, but then I decided to practice writing functions without using recursion. I chose to program with `dart` because it can be turned easily into `javascript` and deployed to the web if necessary.

Currently, it supports untyped Lambda Calculus as well as type construction. Next I will introduce syntactic `fix` and `let` notations.

See [here](example/example.dart) for examples.
